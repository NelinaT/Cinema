This is a fullstack web project. Only for a month I succeeded to do a cinema booking system. I created a page with all the movies and info about them. When you click on movie you are redirected to a page where you can see more info and choose a projection with time,price and type of hall that is suitable for you. After choosing your projection, than you go to the next page where you choose your seat. You can see the hall as available seat are in green, broken ones in grey and the booked are marked in red. After you choose your seat you choose how to pay by card or cash and after that a ticket for this projection i being generated. Every ticket is unique and has movie title, seat, type of hall and qr code. 
Depending on the role people can log as admin, personal or clients.


HOW TO RUN IT:
All you need is to dowload the code and write the following comand in the terminal:  
python manage.py runserver

Than the site will operate on localhost:8000.
